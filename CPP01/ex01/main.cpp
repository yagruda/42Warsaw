/*
Time to create a horde of Zombies!
Implement the following function in the appropriate file:
Zombie* zombieHorde( int N, std::string name );
It must allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then, it must initialize the
zombies, giving each of them the name passed as a parameter. The function returns a
pointer to the first zombie.
Implement your own tests to ensure that your zombieHorde() function works as ex-
pected. Try calling announce() for each of the zombies.
Do not forget to use delete to deallocate all the zombies and check for memory
leaks.
